# Graph Theory 

- This repository comprises a couple of stuff you will need in order to learn Graph Theory: functions use to operate, initialize graphs, and applications in finding paths, reconstructing the code architecture,...

- In each section, there will be a demonstration corresponded with that .cpp file of a specific algorithm as well as its applications
